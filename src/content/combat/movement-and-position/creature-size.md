Each creature takes up a different amount of space. Table: Size Categories shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.
|Size 	      |Space                  |
|-------------|-----------------------|
|Tiny 	      |2½ by 2½ ft.           |
|Small 	      |5 by 5 ft.             |
|Medium 	    |5 by 5 ft.             |
|Large 	      |10 by 10 ft.           |
|Huge 	      |15 by 15 ft.           |
|Gargantuan 	|20 by 20 ft. or larger |
### Space
A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them. A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one. Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.
### Squeezing into a Smaller Space
A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature **one size smaller** than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend **1 extra foot for every foot** it moves there, and it has **disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws**. **Attack rolls** against the creature have **advantage** while it’s in the smaller space.
