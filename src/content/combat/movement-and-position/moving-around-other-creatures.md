You can move through a **nonhostile** creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a **hostile** creature’s space only if the creature is at least **two sizes larger or smaller** than you. Remember that another creature’s space is **difficult terrain** for you. Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you **can’t willingly end your move in its space**. If you leave a hostile creature’s **reach** during your move, you provoke an **opportunity attack**.
