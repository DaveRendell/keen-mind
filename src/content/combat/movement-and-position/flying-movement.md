Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked **prone**, has its **speed reduced to 0**, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature **falls**, unless it has the ability to **hover** or it is being held aloft by **magic**, such as by the fly spell.
