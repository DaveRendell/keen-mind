Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar- choked forests, treacherous staircasesâ€”the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain. **Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot**. This rule is true **even if multiple things in a space count** as difficult terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The **space of another creature**, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.
