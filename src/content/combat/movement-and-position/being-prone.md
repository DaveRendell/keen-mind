Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone. You can **drop prone without using any of your speed**. **Standing up** takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to **half your speed**. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or **if your speed is 0**. To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling **costs 1 extra foot**. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.
