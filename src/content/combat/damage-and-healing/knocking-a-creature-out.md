Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker **reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack**, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the **instant the damage is dealt**. The creature falls **unconscious and is stable**.
