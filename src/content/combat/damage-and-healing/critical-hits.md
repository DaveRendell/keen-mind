When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. **Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice** and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once. For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves **other damage dice**, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you **roll those dice twice as well**.
