Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury. When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the **temporary hit points are lost first**, and any **leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points**. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage. Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, **they can exceed your hit point maximum**. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points. **Healing can’t restore temporary hit points**, and they **can’t be added together**. **If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones**. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22. If you have 0 hit points, **receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you**. They **can still absorb damage** directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you. Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, **they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest**.
