**Once during your move**, you can mount a creature that is **within 5 feet of you** or dismount. **Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed**. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0. If an effect **moves your mount against its will** while you’re on it, you must succeed on a **DC 10 Dexterity saving throw** or fall off the mount, landing **prone** in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re **knocked prone while mounted**, you must make the same saving throw. If your **mount is knocked prone**, you can use your **reaction** to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.
