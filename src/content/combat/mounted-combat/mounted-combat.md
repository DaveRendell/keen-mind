A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide. A **willing creature** that is at **least one size larger** than you and that has an **appropriate anatomy** can serve as a mount.
