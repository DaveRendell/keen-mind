While you’re mounted, you have two options. **You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently**. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently. **You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider**. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. **The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it**. It moves as you direct it, and it **has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge**. A **controlled mount** can **move and act even on the turn that you mount it**. An **independent mount retains its place in the initiative order**. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes. In either case, **if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount**.
