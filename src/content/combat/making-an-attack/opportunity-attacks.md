In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack. You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can **see** moves out of your **reach**. To make the opportunity attack, you use your **reaction** to make **one melee attack** against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach. You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the **Disengage** action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you **teleport** or when someone or something moves you **without using your movement**, **action**, or **reaction**. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.
