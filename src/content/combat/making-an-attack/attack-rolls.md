When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a **d20** and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers **equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class** (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.
### Modifiers to the Roll
When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an **ability modifier** and the character’s **proficiency bonus**. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

Ability Modifier: The ability modifier used for a **melee weapon attack is Strength**, and the ability modifier used for a **ranged weapon attack is Dexterity**. Weapons that have the **finesse** or **thrown** property break this rule. Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a **spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability** of the spellcaster.

Proficiency Bonus: You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a **weapon with which you have proficiency**, as well as when you **attack with a spell**.
### Rolling 1 or 20
Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack **hits regardless of any modifiers** or the target’s AC. This is called a **critical hit**. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack **misses regardless of any modifiers** or the target’s AC.
