When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the **spell assumes the higher level for that casting**. For instance, if Umara casts magic missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spellâ€™s description.
