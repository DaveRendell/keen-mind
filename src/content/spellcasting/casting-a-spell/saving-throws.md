Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The **spell specifies the ability** that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The **DC** to resist one of your spells equals **8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers**.
