A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

**Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all**. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.

To target something, you **must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover**.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is **between you and that point**, the point of origin comes into being **on the near side of that obstruction**.

If a spell targets a creature of your choice, **you can choose yourself**, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.
