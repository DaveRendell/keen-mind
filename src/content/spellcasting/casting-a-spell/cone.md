A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone’s **width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin**. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone’s **point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect**, unless you decide otherwise.
