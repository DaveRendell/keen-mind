A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires **verbal (V)**, **somatic (S)**, or **material (M)** components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.

### Verbal (V)

Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is **gagged** or in an **area of silence**, such as one created by the silence spell, **can’t cast a spell** with a verbal component.

### Somatic (S)

Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have **free use of at least one hand** to perform these gestures.

### Material (M)

Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a **component pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But **if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component** before he or she can cast the spell.

If a spell states that a material component is **consumed by the spell**, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.

A spellcaster **must have a hand free** to access a spell’s material components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—**but it can be the same hand** that he or she uses to perform somatic components.
