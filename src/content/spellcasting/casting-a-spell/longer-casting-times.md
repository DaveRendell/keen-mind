Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you **must spend your action each turn casting the spell**, and you must **maintain your concentration** while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your **concentration is broken**, the spell fails, but you **don’t expend a spell slot**. If you want to try casting the spell again, you **must start over**.
