A cylinder’s point of origin is the **center of a circle of a particular radius**, as given in the spell description. The **circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect**. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder’s **point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect**.
